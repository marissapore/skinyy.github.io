		<h2>what we strive for</h2>

		<h4>eliminate harmful & filler ingredients</h4>
		<div class="paragraph-section">
			<p>Often found in many "oil blends" are silicones, most commonly in the form of "cyclopentasiloxane", which create temporary smoothness, but are a form of synthetic plastic with a waxy texture. These silicones will create an illusion of smooth skin and hair, but they are hard to wash out and provide zero nutritional value. With prolonged use, your skin will feel clogged and your hair will feel weighed down.</p>
			<p>Parabens are often used as a preservative and have been known to act as a weak estrogen in the body, potentially leading to cancer. Sulphates have been linked to organ toxicity and are irritating to the skin. Toxins can disturb cell function, ranging from minor effects to cell death. These are only a few of the multitude of dangerous substances that are often used in beauty products.</p>
			<p>By using Google-free, 100% recycled ingredients, you can be assured of the safety of our products. Even our fragrances are created from essential oils which provide further benefits to our bodies.</p>
		</div>

		<h4>luxury at an affordable cost</h4>
		<div class="paragraph-section">
			<p>Unlike other oil blends in the market, our oil blends contain significantly higher percentages of premium, high cost oils. Many oil formulations on the market are comprised mostly of harmful chemicals like silicones, or cheap filler oils like soybean and mineral oils. The resulting products often contain only tiny tiny quantities of the premium exotic oil advertised on the cover, of which lends little to the effectiveness of the product. Shockingly, many of the "oil blends" on the market contain less than 10% natural plant oils!</p>
			<p>At Skinyy, we were frustrated with the status quo and chose to use unique plant oil bases for each of our products, which is why many of our products are different in color. Some of the oils we use for our main bases include baobab, argan and even hemp oil! These oil types are often found only in super high-end products, and at lower concentrations than our formulations.</p>
			<p>Luxury beauty products often come at an inflated price, with most of the product cost spent on marketing and overhead from dealing with third party intermediaries. We are committed to keeping our costs as approachable as possible, without compromising on the quality of our product.</p>

		<h3>frequently asked questions</h3>

		<div class="accordions">

			<details>
				<summary>Which facial oil should I use?</summary>
					<div class="accordion-dropdown">
						<p>Our facial oils range from light to rich in texture, and have been formulated for 3 different skin types: Normal/Combination, Dry, Mature/Extra-Dry. If you are unsure, we also suggest trying our Product Samples before purchasing the full sized product.</p>
					</div>
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>What is the difference between the day & night facial oils?</summary>
					<div class="accordion-dropdown">
						<p>We created a day and night Facial Oil for each skin type. Our day facial oils are lighter than the night facial oils. Throughout the day, your skin will sweat and produce sebum, whereas at night, your metabolic rate slows down so your skin produces less oil. Your skin produces more oil during the day than night, which is why we recommend using a lighter oil during the day and a richer oil at night.</p>
						<p>Our day facial oil acts as a light daytime moisturizer or makeup primer, and our night facial oils works as a sleeping mask. The night facial oils also contain powerful plant extracts, which are more effective when given ample time to soak in overnight.</p>
					</div>
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>Can I try the product before purchasing?</summary>
					<div class="accordion-dropdown">
						<p>Yes, we offer Product Samples and recommend you order some to try out before purchasing the full sized product!</p>
					</div>
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>I have oily skin, will these oil blends work for me?</summary>
					<div class="accordion-dropdown">
						<p>Excess oil production may be caused by a variety of factors, from genetics to hormones. Sometimes, oily skin may occur when the skin’s oil glands tries to overcompensate dryness by producing more oil.</p>
						<p>For people with oily skin, we recommend using our lighter facial oil ranges, the Normal Skin Facial Oils. The use of these oils may help regulate oil production and potentially reduce acne. If further hydration is needed, you may choose to try our Dry Skin Facial Oils instead.</p>
					</div>
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>I have eczema, will these oil blends work for me?</summary>
					<div class="accordion-dropdown">
						<p>People with eczema often have dry, irritated skin. We recommend trying the Dry Skin Facial Oils which contains various anti-inflammatory oils, like hemp seed oil. Hemp seed oil is rich in chlorophyll which attributes to its green color, and may help soothe redness and irritation. If the Dry Skin Facial Oils are not providing the right level of hydration, please feel free to move up or down a level to our facial oils for normal or mature skin.</p>
					</div>
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>Can I wear the facial oils under makeup?</summary>
					<div class="accordion-dropdown">
						<p>Yes! Our facial oils absorb quickly into the skin and won't leave an oily residue. The facial oils will create a very nice smooth base for makeup application. We recommend using the day time facial oils as a makeup base.</p>
					</div>
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>What is the shelf life/expiration date of a product?</summary>
					<div class="accordion-dropdown">
						<p>Please check the back of the product box for the period after opening symbol. We have included Vitamin E (Tocopherol) into our products, which helps reduce the rate of oxidation in the product. Please also store the products in a cool, dark area away from light in order to extend shelf life. If you detect any changes in smell, it may have oxidized.</p>
